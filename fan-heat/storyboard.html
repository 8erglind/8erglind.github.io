  	Countries: (9 places atm)<br><br>
  	- Brazil (CHECK)<br>
	- (want to include the US but perhaps just from a far, so gather culture from there from people not from there. Idk, I find the idea of ignoring their opinion and rather reflecting our opinion of it onto it a bit interesting... but maybe that is just weird.)<br>
	- Iceland<br>
	- Netherlands (SENT OUT)<br>
	- Norway (SENT OUT)<br>
	<br>
	- (want an african country)<br>
	- (want a middle eastern country)<br>
	- (want India - have a friend there I could ask, but not sure she will respond)<br>
	<br>
	- (want Indonesia, or maybe that is not significant heat-wise as much as flood-wise)<br>
	- (maybe Vietnam)<br>
	- S-Korea (CHECK)<br>
